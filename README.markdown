The Perl module NetObj::IPv4Address represents [IPv4
addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4).  The goal is to use an
abstraction independent of any particular string representation.

NetObj::IPv4Address is a class built using [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo)
and fits right into the [Moose](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose) object oriented
framework.
